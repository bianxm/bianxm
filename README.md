## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bianca, ex-Data Center Mechanical Technician, current Software Engineer. They/them pronouns, please!

I recently concluded a 14-week full stack bootcamp at Hackbright Academy, and a 10-week back end-focused internship at Shipt. I'm currently working on getting my AWS CCP certificate, and building out [Peril](https://github.com/bianxm/peril), a Jeopardy game where the players also supply the questions. I also write about my learnings [on Hashnode](https://bianxm.hashnode.dev/).

I also maintain [Forkd](https://github.com/bianxm/forkd-backend), a GitHub-inspired recipe version control and journalling web app. [Try it out]((http://3.14.77.97/)!
